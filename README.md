## Generate Verifiable Credentials (in both EIP712 and JWT format) with Veramo

The express-veramo directory exposes several API paths for creating and verifying Verifiable Credentials using Veramo.

## Save and Query Verifiable Credentials on ComposeDB (Ceramic Network)

The client directory contains ComposeDB schema definitions, a ComposeDB server configuration suitable for local development, pre-written queries, and a simple UI to show how credentials generated from Veramo can be saved to and queried from ComposeDB (on the Ceramic Network).
